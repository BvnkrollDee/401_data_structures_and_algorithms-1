# Class 05: Linked Lists

- **Why**
    - Every 5th class we generally introduce a new Data Structure
- **What**
    - Refer to the [Data Structure Documentation](./resources/singly_linked_list.md)
- **How**
    - Follow the [Demo Code](./demos)
      - If no demos exist for your language then add an issue and/or create some.
    - Linked Lists are a brand new concept for many students, and there can be an intimidation factor. It can be helpful to use physical objects. For example...
      - Each student in class will represent a `Node` at a particular memory location.
      - Before class, create pieces of paper for all N students in the class. Each piece of paper specifies their memory address (a number 1-N) and the address of the next node (1-N) to create an N-length linked list. (It can be helpful to write down the complete list, e.g. 3->2->4->1->6->5->NULL, and then create each of the cards that has an address and a next.)
      - Give each student a playing card (value), and one of those pieces of paper.
      - The playing card represents the node's `value` property (NB: it's not just an integer).
      - Walk through process of finding the last `value`.
      - Walk through process of adding a node to the beginning.
      - Walk through process of determining if a given `value` aka `card` is in the list.
    - Add more ideas here as you try them out.

## General Comments

    - Often times a `Node` value is presented as a single value, typically a number. This can lead to students getting confused when dealing with composite values and/or multiple `values`. Reiterate to them that they are in control of the shape of the Node and it should adjust to meet the needs of the problem domain.
