# Code Challenge

Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph

## Specifications

- Read all of these instructions carefully.
- Name things exactly as described.
- Do all your work in a your `data-structures-and-algorithms` public repository.
- Create a new branch in your repo named as noted below.
- Follow the language-specific instructions for the challenge type listed below.
- Update the "Table of Contents" - in the README at the root of the repository - with a link to this challenge's README file.

### Challenge Setup & Execution

**Branch Name:** `graph-depth-first`

**Challenge Type:** Extending an Implementation

## Feature Tasks

Write the following method for the Graph class:

- Name: Depth first
- Arguments: Node (Starting point of search)
- Return: A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order
- Program output: Display the collection

## Example

![Graph](Day28Example.PNG)

Output:
`A, B, C, G, D, E, H, F`

## Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
