# Course Syllabus: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Course Information

### Course Number: DSA-401

## Course Prerequisites

- Code 201
- Code 301

> Students with previous relevant or equivalent experience can test out of this requirement in their application.

## Course Description

Data Structures and Algorithms 401 is designed to introduce students to classic data structures, problem solving techniques, and complexity analysis. This creates a solid computer science, architectural, and engineering foundation.

## Course Materials

- Code Editor/IDE

## Program Learning Outcomes

Develops algorithmic thinking and problem solving skills, working under stress, and visual breakdowns.

## Student Learning Outcomes

Upon satisfactory completion of this material, a student should be able to:

### Describe and Define

- Algorithmic Complexity (Big-O)
- Best use cases for the major data structures
- Requirements, methods, and limitations for the major data structures
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees
  - Hash Tables
  - Graphs

### Execute & Demonstrate

- Problem solving, using a whiteboard
- Algorithmic thinking
- Asymptotic analysis (time and space) of an algorithm
- Implementation of core functionality (methods) of the data structures
- Iterative and recursive traversal of the data structures, as appropriate
- Test-driven development

## Course Schedule

Each course module includes 5 DS&A assignments, structured with the following schedule:

- Assignment 1: Data structure theory, major implementation, tests
- Assignments 2, 3, 4: Code challenge: whiteboard interview question
- Assignment 5: Mock interviews: with an assigned partner, complete a mock whiteboard interview
