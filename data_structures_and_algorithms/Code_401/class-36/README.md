# Code Challenge

Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.

## Specifications

- Read all of these instructions carefully.
- Name things exactly as described.
- Do all your work in a your `data-structures-and-algorithms` public repository.
- Create a new branch in your repo named as noted below.
- Follow the language-specific instructions for the challenge type listed below.
- Update the "Table of Contents" - in the README at the root of the repository - with a link to this challenge's README file.

### Challenge Setup & Execution

**Branch Name:** `graph-breadth-first`

**Challenge Type:** Extending an Implementation

## Feature Tasks

Write the following method for the Graph class:

- breadth first
- Arguments: Node
- Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
- Display the collection

## Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge.
You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

## Example

![Graph](graph.PNG)

**Output:**

```
Pandora, Arendelle, Metroville, Monstroplolis, Narnia, Naboo
```

## Stretch Goal

Once you've achieved a working solution, define a new method that accepts two nodes as input and uses
your traversal algorithm to determine if a path exists between the two nodes.
