# Class 26: Insertion Sort

- **Why**
  - Introduce several Array sorting algorithms this week, starting with Insertion Sort.
- **What**
  - There was no Data Structure intro lecture, but students should be well acquainted with Arrays by now and have at least passing understanding of sorting.
- **How**
  - **In person**: decks of cards are great at communicating sorting concept.
  - **Remote**: Use a diagram tool like [DrawIO](https://app.diagrams.net/){:target="_blank"} which allows easy swapping of items.
  - [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms](https://youtu.be/BgKtheXUAAI) has great example of using playing cards.
  - Follow the [Demo Code](./demos){:target="_blank"} 
    - If no demos exist for your language then add an issue and/or create some.
  - Plan on step by step walk through of the visuals and pseudo code in the challenge assignment.

## General comments

- The Sorting labs are different because they require creation of a blog (or an approved alternate approach.) 
- Review the sample [BLOG.md](./solutions/BLOG.md){:target="_blank"}
- Emphasize that the sample blog does **NOT** cover the same sorting algorithm as the challenge.
