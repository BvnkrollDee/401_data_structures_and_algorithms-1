# Class 10: Stacks and Queues

- **Why**
  - Introduce Stack and Queue data structures
- **What**
  - Refer to the [Data Structure Documentation](./resources/stacks_and_queues.md)
- **How**
  - Discuss how both Stacks and Queues build upon data structures they've already seen.
  - Explain how their power comes from doing less vs. more.
    - I.e. You can treat an array like a stack, but communicating the intended use via a public interface makes your code much easier to reason about.
  - Follow the [Demo Code](./demos)
    - If no demos exist for your language then add an issue and/or create some.
  - Plan on step by step walk through of the visuals and pseudo code in the resource doc.

## General comments

- I like using playing cards to have tangible objects to deepen understanding.
  - Playing cards lend themselves to both stacks and queues.
- Anything that lends itself to physically stacking is good candidate for Stacks.
- Lining students up to get a movie ticket, hamburger, etc. good for queues.
- Refer back to Call Stack and Event Loop discussion in 301 JavaScript that most students were part of.
- Add more ideas here as you try them out.
