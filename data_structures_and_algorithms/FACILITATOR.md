# Data Structures and Algorithms - Code Challenges

401 level Code Challenges are typically broken up into 3 types. 

1. A lab to introduce new data structure
1. Three subsequent code challenges to explore/reinforce the data structure.
1. A mock interview betweeen pair of students.
 
 A common source of friction with students is time management. Students will often spend an inordinate amount of time getting their Code Challenges perfect at the expense of their lab assignment. It is worthwile reminding students that the Code Challenges intentionally account for fewer points than labs. Also reassure students that Code Challenges are generally easier to circle back on later than labs.

## Whiteboard
When assignment requires whiteboarding students should follow the [Whiteboard Workflow](./Whiteboard_Workflow.md){:target="_blank"} and include photo of their white board in assignment submission.

Having students demo portions of their white board solution does a great job of reducing anxiety for final interview. Try to allow multiple times per week for drilling down on different aspects of grading rubric, problem decomposition, code fluency, etc.


## Testing
After whiteboarding students should create tests individually using [Testing Workflow](./Testing_Workflow.md){:target="_blank"} as guide. 

Doing Test Driven Development on Code Challenges can be a great approach. During the DSA Lab review consider using TDD to build out the data structures.
