## Course Information

### Course Number: DSA-301

## Course Prerequisites

- Code 201

> Students with previous relevant or equivalent experience can test out of this requirement in their application.

## Course Description

Data Structures and Algorithms 301 is designed to introduce students the concepts of TDD and algorithmic thinking using high level data structures (Objects and Arrays) in JavaScript

## Course Materials

- Code Editor/IDE

## Program Learning Outcomes

Develops algorithmic thinking and problem solving skills, working under stress, and visual breakdowns.

## Student Learning Outcomes

Upon satisfactory completion of this course, a student should be able to:

### Describe and Define

- Best use cases for the common data structures
- Suitability to task (best option) for JavasScript internal methods
- Rules, methods, limitations, use cases for the major data structures
  - Arrays
  - Objects

### Execute & Demonstrate

- Array Methods: `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`
- Array Sorting
- Array manipulation: Loops, splice, slice
- String manipulation: splice, slice, substrings
- Regular Expressions
- Algorithmic Thinking
- Test Driven Development
